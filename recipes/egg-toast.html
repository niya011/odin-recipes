    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>On most days, there is one thing I like
        to eat every morning without fail. Eggs. Recently, I've been obsessed
        with eggs on toast and thought I would share the recipe. Enjoy!
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs (however many you want to eat)</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Red Chili Powder</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Sandwich Spread</li>
        <li>Hot Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put your bread in the toaster and let it toast
            while you make the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>In a warm and oiled pan, break your eggs carefully
            so the yolks don't crack.
        </li>
        <li>While the eggs cook on one side, add your salt, red chili,
            and black pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Once you think the eggs have cooked on one side, flip them
            over and let them cook more. While this happens, take your toasted 
            bread and apply your sandwich spread to each toast.
        </li>
        <li>Plate the individual eggs on each toast and add cheese on top
            if you want. Sprinkle some hot sauce on top of the eggs as well.
        </li>
    </ol>
