    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes! Pasta is a very versatile
        dish, and there are many ways to make it. This recipe I'm sharing
        today blends the flavors of tomato, red chilis, and mozzerella, to 
        provide a tasty, spicy, and cheesy pasta dish.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Penne Pasta</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Red Pasta Sauce</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Red Chili Flakes (or powder)</li>
        <li>Chopped Onions</li>
        <li>Schezwan Sauce</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Mozzerella Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil your pasta for 11-15 minutes. Drain the Water
            and let the pasta sit while you make the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in the pasta sauce to let it heat, and 
            chop a full onion while it heats up.
        </li>
        <li>In the pasta sauce, add in your schezwan sauce, salt, and 
            red chili. (You can add some black pepper too, but it's not
            required.)
        </li>
        <li>Add the sour cream last, and make sure the heat
            is turned down low when you do it. Mix everything well.
        </li>
        <li>When everything is mixed thouroughly, add your boiled pasta to
            the sauce. Keep the heat low and stir for a few minutes to
            heat up the pasta and make sure the sauce coats it all.
        </li>
        <li>Plate the pasta, and add cheese to your liking. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
